# Step 4: Flask Web Frontend

Create a Flask app to:
- Search by name or address
- Display results in a table
- Export results to Excel and download
- Delete the Excel file after download

## Example (Flask Route):
```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, send_file
# ...existing code...
```

See `app.py` for implementation details.
