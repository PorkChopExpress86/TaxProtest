- [ ] Dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Database downloaded and loaded (`data/database.sqlite` exists)
- [ ] Directory structure created (`downloads/`, `extracted/`, `data/`, `logs/`, `Exports/`)

### ✅ Security Configuration
- [ ] SECRET_KEY environment variable set (production only)
- [ ] Debug mode disabled for production
- [ ] File upload limits configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (production)

### ✅ Database & Storage
- [ ] SQLite database accessible (`data/database.sqlite`)
- [ ] Write permissions for `Exports/` directory

## Production Deployment

### Option 1: Simple Production Server
```bash
# Set environment variables
export SECRET_KEY="your-production-secret-key"
export FLASK_ENV="production"

# Disable debug mode
# Edit app.py: app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=False)

# Run with production WSGI server
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```

### Option 3: Cloud Deployment
- **Heroku**: Add `Procfile` with `web: gunicorn app:app`
